# Fine-tuning DistillBERT for NLP Tasks

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `Finetuning_DistillBERT.ipynb`, that demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the DistillBERT model for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide for adapting this lightweight transformer-based model to specific datasets and tasks such as text classification or sentiment analysis.

## Features

- **Pretrained Model Loading**:
  - Utilize the pre-trained DistillBERT model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library.

- **Dataset Preparation**:
  - Load and preprocess text datasets for compatibility with the DistillBERT tokenizer and model.

- **Fine-tuning**:
  - Implement fine-tuning with specific datasets for tasks like sentiment analysis, topic classification, or other NLP tasks.
  - Use learning rate scheduling and optimizers to improve training efficiency.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

- **Visualization**:
  - Plot training and validation metrics over epochs.
  - Visualize the impact of fine-tuning on predictions.

## Datasets

The notebook is designed to work with text-based datasets. Examples include:

- **IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**:
  - For binary sentiment classification (positive/negative).

- **Custom Text Datasets**:
  - Users can provide their own text datasets in `.csv` or `.txt` formats.

Make sure the datasets are properly preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets for best results.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required libraries:
  - `transformers` (for DistillBERT)
  - `datasets` (optional, for loading standard datasets)
  - `torch`
  - `sklearn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch sklearn matplotlib pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
